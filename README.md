# Introduction.
We all love ESP32 microcontroller, In any of IOT Project we often use ESP32 module.

ESP32 is one of the power full and pretty famous microcontroller in the field of IOT.

ESP32 comes with lot of amazing and useful features, like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity which enables wide-range of applications.

I have made lot of projects using this ESP32 module.

This ESP32 module comes only in black color, So I decided why not ,We give a fresh look to this esp32 module. then, I designed my version of esp32 module, which is purple in color. and this purple color esp32 module looks beautiful.

This ESP32 module has been made using JLPCB PCB assembly Services.

# Specifications
ESP32-WROOM-32 chipset is used in this module which is very powerful and this chipset is integrated with WIFI, BT, BLE, Which enables wide range of applications.

There are two CPU cores that can be individually controlled, and the CPU clock frequency is adjustable from 80 MHz to 240 Mhz.

ESP32 integrates a rich set of peripherals, like capacitive touch sensors, Hall sensors, SD card interface, Ethernet, high-speed SPI, UART, I²S and I²C.

The sleep current of the ESP32 chip is less than 5 µA, which make it suitable for battery powered and wearable electronics applications.
The programming chip I have used in this ESP32 is CH340C...which is very popular, CH340C is a Serial to USB converter and vice -versa. This chip has been used in some boards such as Arduino boards , ESP8266 board, and in many other modules.

It Supports baud rate from 2400bps to 115200bps.(1 lakh 15 thousand 2 hundred Bps)

CH340C provide full duplex serial interface, and also we can set transceiver buffer.

This CH340C is compatible with 3.3V and 5V I/Os.
